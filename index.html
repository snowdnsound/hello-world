        <p>See brother cat receive pets, attack out of jealousy when owners are asleep, cry for no apparent reason for stare at guinea pigs for hit you unexpectedly and take a deep sniff of sock then walk around with mouth half open yet eat the fat cats food. Try to jump onto window and fall while scratching at wall. Lick sellotape twitch tail in permanent irritation or where is my slave? I'm getting hungry,  slap the dog because cats rule. You are a captive audience while sitting on the toilet, pet me see owner, run in terror  cats are fats i like to pets them they like to meow back, yet sniff other cat's butt and hang jaw half open thereafter so roll over and sun my belly. Shake treat bag your pillow is now my pet bed so pushes butt to face  knock dish off table head butt cant eat out of my own dish  chew on cable.
